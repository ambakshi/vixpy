Build / install with

    python setup.py build
        
        or (for the brave)

    python setup.py install

    
 >>> import vixpy

 See example.py for usage.


Notes
- Vmware does not provide a 64-bit VIX library for Windows. Must use 32-bit Python.
- VMWARE_ vars in setup.py should be adjusted appropriately


TODO
- Auto find VIX libs on Windows
- Auto "set" Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH 


Linux Notes

Need to install VIX bundle if VMWare not installed
# sh VMware-VIX-1.10.3-368992.x86_64.bundle -x /some/install/directory

Python needs to be able to find VIX library at run time
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/some/install/directory/vmware-vix/lib python somescript.py
